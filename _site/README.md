# Co-op Soc Website

# Files
Files ending in `.html` and not in folders are the main pages you see on the website.
- `assets/` contains the navigation bar and the footer, make sure to add those to each page if you're creating a new one.

- `pubs/` is where new publications are added and then linked to the `publications.html` file

- `css/`, `grayscale.css` is where changes are made the CSS of the website - named that because it was the name of the template.

- can probably ignore `scss/` and `js/` as well as `vendor/`

- Add all images to `images/`
