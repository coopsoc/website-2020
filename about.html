                                    Stepping into the role of President, my ultimate goal is to foster a strong community full of everlasting friendships and life-long memories by overseeing all facets of the society. I want to enhance the cohesion of Co-op Soc by ensuring that the incoming 2021 first-years feel welcomed into the Co-op family, and by also increasing the involvement of third and fourth years. Overall, despite what 2021 throws at us, get keen for a good time!

                                    My biggest goal stepping into this position is to facilitate the creation of long lasting memories and aid the development of the strongest community in UNSW - the co-op family. Not only does this entail running fantastic, consistent events and overseeing an online presence, but it also involves ensuring a key support network is maintained and all voices are heard, not just within the Executive team but throughout the society.

My vision is to not only maintain the society’s health, but to help grow the Co-op community as a whole by keeping track of our historical records, meetings, goals, plans, contact with external organisations, members, and events to name a few!

                                    Over the coming year, my main goal is to cultivate and strengthen the bonds within the Co-op community.

                                    For 2021, with Kesh, I aim to create an environment where co-ops are provided with a multitude of opportunities to make an impact outside of the corporate world and inside the wider community. In order to achieve this, we will be providing you all with events supporting a range of impactful charities as well as our own initiatives which not only allow co-ops a chance to give back, but also bring us all closer together as we do so.

With my position as marketing director, I hope to use the power of social media to reach out to every member and facilitate long-lasting relationships between a diverse range of people, creating valuable memories and a truly unique community.

                                    Over the following year as IT Director, I’m hoping to cultivate the society’s online presence, channelling my creativity and love for tech into the Co-op Soc website. I’m looking forward to co-leading the first Pubs/IT Sub-committee as Jack and I strengthen the partnership between our two roles, introducing Co-op Soc Instagram and monthly newsletters. I’m also planning to introduce a new way to create and display blog posts from within the website.

                                    As a first year representative, I aim to represent the interests of the 2021 Co-op Soc cohort and forge stronger connections between our cohort and the Co-op Soc Executive team. Our responsibilities involve creating and distributing the 2021 Co-op merchandise, as well as contributing to planning events throughout the year. Ultimately, I hope that we are able to create opportunities for our cohort to grow closer together and make the most of their experience within Co-op.
