                                    I'm Roary, I’m currently spending my first placement in the SIAM (Service Integration and Management) department at AMP.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                One great thing about placement is that whilst your agreement may put you in a certain team or role, it is up to you to seek experiences in whatever you are interested in, and since this placement is my first, I was interested in everything. This advice was given to me by a few mentors, so I reached out and am now working on 3 separate projects in different teams across our department, providing me with a helpfully wholistic view of SIAM as originally I had no clue what it even stood for.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                My original assignment is with the Strategy team, in which we’re currently in the design stage of delivering a technical strategy. We’ve had countless workshops together as we gathered around whiteboards in meeting rooms, defining the scope of our strategy and the best ways to implement it with the resources we have available. Don’t fall for the stereotypes of seclusion in working in technology; it can be very enjoyably interpersonal and collaborative.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                However, I was also very interested in improving my technical skills during placement, and so I volunteered to take interim ownership of our department’s configuration database. With no previous experience, I’ve had to learn both on my own as well as by seeking help from experts on how to operate its several nuances; a challenge for sure, but I can appreciate the knowledge and experience it brings.
                                </p>

                                Finally, my favourite initiative at AMP is leading an uplift of our team’s culture. Our new team basketball tournament was very successful and surprisingly competitive, however considering the current circumstances, we’re now enjoying online Skribbl.io sessions.

                                    What are some challenges you have encountered and how did you overcome them?

                                <p class="modal-text">
                                    Whilst first placement is a great opportunity to jump into a whole new world of new experiences, I made the mistake of saying yes to every piece of work offered to me and ended up overloading myself with commitments (at one point I was on 5 different projects). This meant I found myself working overtime/taking work home several days of the week, which I decided was unsustainable and not something I wanted to continue.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                    I reached out to mentors at work who told me this was a great lesson in managing the expectations of your managers, or better yet not getting yourself into this situation in the first place by knowing how much work you can/are willing to handle.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                    The first step was to decide which projects I was most engaged in, and the value that I could both add and receive from each of them. This led me to pushing aside an administrative role which I felt I wasn’t getting much value from, as well as a role in Service Economics which I didn’t feel engaged in.
                                </p>
                                <p class="modal-text">
                                    The second step was to work out how to push back on these commitments, by communicating my situation in the right way to their managers and figuring out any necessary compromises. Overall, I now feel much more engaged and comfortable with my workload; however, this could all have been avoided had I understood my capacity from the start and said no.

                                <p class="modal-text">
                                    One upside of working full-time is the structure it pushes into your life – 7am wakeups eventually began to feel normal rather than soul crushing. Having a significant chunk of your Monday to Friday committed to work leaves you with a much clearer indication of the time you have available for other things.                       
                                </p>

                                    I would say a balance is very achievable with timetabling skills and ascertaining what your priorities are, and therefore knowing what you would sacrifice.

                                    To be honest, I would never have expected the people I work with to be so relatable, supportive, and fun to get along with. I’m lucky to be placed in the youngest team at AMP, with co-workers who grew up in the same generation with the same memes and culture – but the real surprise comes from how easy it is to talk to almost everyone else, too. This actually becomes fairly important when it comes to seeking help from senior employees and managers, as I’ve never felt any hesitation speaking up to them or asking questions – it feels perfectly natural to laugh at some of their attempts to draw a cat on Skribbl.io too.

                                    Of course, there are a few people at work who I find to have personalities that are hard to agree with at times. The best advice I can give for this is to just expect it and take it as what it is.

                                        My tasks are very diverse and are primarily completed on a monthly basis. This includes internal management reporting for scorecards/dashboards as well as cost variance analysis. I’ve also dabbled in working capital and capital project reporting as well as general accounting tasks such as posting journals and completing reconciliations. Many exciting ad hoc tasks and projects also arise within my role.

                                        This is an extremely valuable opportunity - it isn’t the stereotypical ‘intern’ role you see in movies so don’t expect to be doing coffee runs. You will be given meaningful tasks that make a real difference in your organisation so really give it your all. In fact, go even further! If you see or hear about a project you’re interested in, ask your manager if you can sit in on some meetings and get involved.

                                        Be curious – ask WHY not just what! <br />
                                        I remember my first few weeks of induction going over tasks required in my role. Written process notes were usually handed over so what was most important to know was the WHY. Don’t get too stuck in the mechanical steps of a process – if you understand why you’re doing it and how it relates to other tasks/business units, you will gain far more knowledge and get much more out of it.

                                        Mistakes are inevitable. I came into my placement having completed only 2 accounting courses, so I was by no means an expert in the field.  I was exposed to many new accounting concepts and the business had their own unique processes I had to learn. Remember that you’re not expected to know everything. Don’t be embarrassed to ask for clarification or feedback from your manager – get the most out of this work experience.

Particularly during my first month, I had to deal with the fact that I didn’t really know how to complete certain tasks. I overcame this by asking lots of questions to clarify expectations. I am extremely grateful that my manager, colleagues and the general culture of CCA is really open and everyone is willing to offer a helping hand.

                                        A major challenge that I had experienced on placement was the inefficiency when co-operating with client data science teams. The first complication was a result of delayed communication on the client side subsequently delaying our work by a month or so. When resolving this issue, a heavy focus on efficient and clear communication with my manager and client were required to accelerate the process of receiving data.

Upon receiving the data, I was completely overwhelmed and struggled to comprehend the dozen excel tables that were presented to me. There was no shortcut to resolving this complication and I simply had to persevere and commit to trudging through all the data. The importance of getting hands on is undeniable, and in this case was the only way to move forward.

Whilst this may contrast your belief that working longer hours and spending more time on a project is beneficial to your corporate image, it is important to understand that unless you have a deadline to meet, the most efficient and time-conscious method is always preferred. Pay especially close attention to detail on your first go and always aim to complete a task in your first try. Undoubtedly this will not always work out in your favour, but the more accurate, precise and attentive you are when completing a task on your first attempt the faster you will complete all tasks.

I talked to a few older co-ops and they advised me that it generally takes a bit of time to start feeling more comfortable in the office.

My first initiative was that every time I went to get tea and saw a person I didn't know, I would introduce myself. This was super scary but the more I did it the easier it became for me and it really helped me get out of my shell. After the first two months I eventually met at least one person from each team on a floor of 150 people and it helped me settle in.

                                    Furthermore, you should be actively taking on work and getting involved with things like office sport or events as much as you can. I believe that being proactive in meeting people has a big change on whether you enjoy your placement or not.

                                    Since I am considering taking up Information systems as my second major, I would love to work at Salesforce. The skills I have learnt at AMEX so far have been more soft skills rather than technical due to the nature of my team. After hearing about the work culture at Salesforce and the amount of responsibility they place on interns, I believe it will be a great place to build upon my existing skillset and grow.

                                    What’s the culture like at American Express?

                                    Every time I tell someone at American Express that this is my first internship they always say that it is a great place to start, I believe that this is very true. I have found the culture at American Express to be one that is very friendly and socially orientated. That being said, I found that as a new person, you need to take the initiative and introduce yourself to people first.

                                    However, I believe that is true in nearly any organisation I been part of. AMEX also has a massive intern culture because they recruit about 15-20 interns at a time. Having an intern family to have lunches with and just vibe with has been super helpful within my time at AMEX.
